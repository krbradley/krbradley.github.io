        After 24 hours of travelling, I finally arrived to the Heathrow airport in London. Richard greeted me at the airport and we struggled with my heavy luggage to the Easy Hotel. My body was in shock. I left warm sunny, 90F Indiana and entered chilly 50F London.

		In London, we visited the typical tourist sites. The Borough Market is a must. It is a huge market under railway lines. I chose to devour an Ethopian dish from one of the vendors.
		</p>
		<p id="para">
		Richard and I went on our first date to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The musical took me to another world. The glass elevator came to life. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is my absolute favorite story.

		Our flat in Sheffield is perfect. We have a small balcony, slightly larger than a Juliet balcony and surrounded by greenery. The kitchen and living room are connected and spacious for the two of us. Above the kitchen is a mezzanine. We claimed this space as our office. The past few days have been filled with finding the perfect additions to make our flat feel like a home.

		<p id="para">
		We found a second hand shop which benefits the homeless community in Sheffield. I could get lost in the buildings with furniture and knick knacks piled from wall to wall.
		</p>
		<p id="para">
		We ended the weekend with a meal and drink at a local pub with Richard's parents. Having his family helps me feel more at home.
