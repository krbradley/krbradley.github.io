{"name":"Kisha Bradley","tagline":"Engineering. Management. Girl.","body":"### Welcome, enjoy and criticise!\r\nI am a twenty something year old trying to decide what I want to do for the time being. I am fighting the urge to find comfort in the norm. Today, I am a studying Management in England. I am not sure what will happen in September when my studies end. I am exploring my options of joining the workforce, starting my own business or applying for my PhD. All options seem equally terrifying and exciting. One thing is certain, I am being picky about what I apply for.\r\n\r\n### Master's Dissertation\r\nAs part of my degree, I will be undertaking a dissertation topic. I am currently in the process of deciding what research topic I will be committing the next 6 months of my life to. I will be exploring topics and my findings through this blog. I will be using methods and frameworks taught in the Management Inquiry module at the University of Sheffield.\r\n\r\n### Other Community Happenings\r\nSheffield is the rustic city of my dreams. It has a small town feel and is surrounded by nature. Perfect for a running/hiking girl from Indiana. While I am adjusting to the hills, I am also enjoying meeting new people and networking. As part of this journey, I document different happenings in the community (one of my favourites being Startup Weekend Sheffield). \r\n\r\n### Building a Blog\r\nThis blog is also a space for me to experiment building a website. As it progresses and grows, more of it will be mine and less will be from other sources. The current page is a template from GitHub. Also, a big shout out to Peter Klein (@kleinpa) for answering all my crazy website related questions.\r\n","google":"UA-73857224-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
