According to Women in Science, Technology and Engineering (WISE), women are only 14.4% of the STEM workforce in England as of August 2015. In 13 out of 16 of the GCSE STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) topics, girls outperformed boys. GCSE STEM is the equivalent of math and science for the SATs in the USA. From my personal experience, 20% of my peers, at an engineering college, were females (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, 2010). If women are outperforming men in STEM subjects, why are we not pursuing STEM careers?

I want to gain a better understanding of why girls do not pursue STEM degrees and careers. Jacqueline Chen and Wesley Moons conducted a study on women and their perceived interpersonal power. In their article, 'They won't listen to me: Anticipated power and women's disinterest in male-dominated domains,' they discuss the importance of motivation through interpersonal power, the ability to influence others. This also relates to Vroom's expectancy theory: we will be motivated, if we think our abilities will result in high performance, and high performance will lead to a desirable reward. 

I have established that women can perform above standards. But do women gain a desirable reward? Before we perform, we have to decide if the reward is worth pursuing. Chen and Moons study deems interpersonal power as the reward. Do women perceive they will be able to influence their peers? Their study found that women think they will have less interpersonal power when the majority of their co-workers are men. Women do not pursue STEM degrees and careers, because they do not think their potential colleagues will listen and trust their expertise. This study only considers one source of motivation. There are many well-known motivators under public scrutiny - fair salary and maternity leave to state a couple. 

In future research, I will focus on perceived and actual interpersonal power of women. I am starting with the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>Once women have a career in engineering, do they think they have interpersonal power within the group?</li> 
	<li>Do males trust and respect the work of women within the group?</li>
	<li>What is the group dynamic?</li>
	<li>How do male and female groups communicate and respond to varying levels interpersonal power?</li> 
	<li>Who has the power of persuasion within co-ed groups?</li>
</ul>


Please let me know if you have further questions or thoughts on my findings so far.
