## International Women’s Month
It’s International Women’s Month! I am excited to celebrate our progress toward equality and how we can continue improving our stance.

## Learning about intersectionality
Living in a new country and experiencing a new culture ultimately leads to me understanding more about myself and how I am perceived by the rest of the world. Next week I will be attending a meeting on “intersectionality.” Before today, I had no idea a significant part of my life could be expressed in one word.

This term was first used by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, a black feminist lawyer, in 1989. According to the Oxford Dictionary, intersectionality is “the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.” Intersectionality is especially relevant to black, LGBT and disabled females in the US. It is literally the intersection of two social experiences.

## My lack of verbal response to discrimination
While I agree discrimination exists and I have experienced it, I try not to let it bother me. Often, I avoid conversations surrounding racial discrimination. I do this for three reasons:
<ul>
<li>I associate with both races and don’t want to classify either race as being discriminatory.</li>
<li>The “other” side always disagrees, and I end up stuck in the middle.</li>
<li>There were few other females of mixed race in my community. Negative comments about my differences were a common occurrence, but there were rarely opportunities to discuss why those comments were inappropriate. Few others could relate to my experience.</li>
</ul>
Instead, I resorted to disproving the stereotypes through my actions and leading by example. (Moment to brag: I am almost certain this is why I got the BAMF award in university!)

But next week, I get to listen to people discuss their opinions and experiences. If I am feeling brave, I may ask a few questions and share my personal experiences with people who are genuinely interested. Most importantly, others will teach me valuable lessons about my personal culture and give me insights to how my perspective of the world was shaped.
