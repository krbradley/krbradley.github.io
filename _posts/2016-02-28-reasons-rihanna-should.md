Rihanna shook her tush and Adele cried thanks with profanity. The public and Brit Awards deemed Adele’s choice of words as offensive. Some argued Rihanna was expressing her artistic right and being the face of female liberation. The family programme sent a clear message that foreplay in the form of dance is okay for mainstream television. If you missed Rihanna’s performance, you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/SQWqksdE4gw?t=3m30s).

Here are four of the many reasons Rihanna should have left her booty poppin’ moves out of the Brit Awards:

## 1. Public display of foreplay: the lesser of two evils
During the Brit Awards, the public was outraged by Adele’s choice of words during her thank you speech. The online version of the show made up for the error by muting portions of her speech including “profanity.” Adele’s cussing was condemned under the watershed time of 9pm. Rihanna’s artful approach to foreplay happened shortly after the watershed period began. Rihanna’s bumping and grinding with Drake was inadvertently chosen as the lesser of two evils when the Brit Awards apologised for [Adele’s profanity](https://youtu.be/sMGr3N6KoTQ) slipping through before the “bleep man” could catch it.

## 2. Art is no excuse for forcing the bump and grind
Art sells, but so does sex. Dancing is art. Regardless if we argue for or against bumping and grinding as art, Rihanna forced it. The entire performance flirted with the line of hip hop dance and risqué. Then Drake appears and for the last few seconds, she rubs her backside against his package. What artistic message was Rihanna sending? I argue, this last minute addition of grinding was not art.

## 3. The Brit Awards is a family programme
Her performance sent a message to admirers, “If you see a man (or Drake), turn around and back it up.” Celebrities get to decide culture norms. I accept and appreciate her work as an alternative lifestyle, but the Brit Awards are a mainstream television programme aimed at families of varying backgrounds and lifestyles. Save the grind for programmes that are post 9pm in their entirety. 

## 4.  Equality and respect for women
Sex is normal. Talking about sex and understanding where your values lie, is important. Again, people choose different lifestyles. While some may appreciate the beauty of women being able to display sexual performances, others see it as taking liberties too far. Deciding where the moral line lies is a difficult task. One thing is certain, women are making progress. The pay gap is narrowing and people are becoming more aware of the struggles women face day to day. 

Research has proven women make purchasing decisions based on ideals. Ideals are set by social norms. Women are still portrayed as sexual objects used to sell services and products, because the majority of pop culture defines being sexy as the norm for women. In order to change the way women are degraded in media, we have to take a stand against provocative displays in mainstream media, including Rihanna’s performance at the Brit Awards.

There were definitely other questionable occurrences of the Brit Awards objectifying women. Rhianna’s dancing was the high profile and obvious stunt of women objectifying women. The questionable nature of her performance was trending on Twitter. As was the hypocrisy surrounding Adele’s speech being muted but allowing Rihanna to bump and grind. The family programme failed to recognise what is appropriate for mainstream television and undermined the progress of women in society.
